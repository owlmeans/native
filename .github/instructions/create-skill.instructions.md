# Creating a GitHub Copilot Instruction File

Instruction files live in `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md`.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
description: "What it covers and when Copilot should load it"
applyTo: "**/pattern/**"   # glob: which files trigger this instruction
---
```

## Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `description` | Required — tells Copilot when to load this instruction |
| `applyTo` | Glob pattern — files that trigger loading |

## After Creating an Instruction

1. If the instruction absorbed memory content, shrink the source `.agents/memory/` node to a pointer line (memory-promotion instruction) — the memory index does not list instructions
2. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` Additional Context section if important

## Instruction vs Memory File

- **Instruction**: reusable procedures, coding conventions Copilot should apply actively
- **Memory node** (`.agents/memory/*.md`): fact-shaped knowledge per the agent-memory instruction; procedure-shaped or repeatedly-touched memory promotes (memory-promotion instruction)
